# Indentation in Python

number = 10
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("Given number {} is Even Number".format({number}))
        # print("Your bad") # we have to take the same indentation in the same block
else:
        print("Odd number") # Although we can use different indentation in different block as we have used one 'tab' here



# We can define variables in 2 way Single value and Multiple values. For ex.

name = "akhil"  # Single value

name, age, gender = "akhil", 26, "male" # Multiple values



# Loops in Python
